I designed a simple project like YouTube on the frontend and implemented the backend for this project using Python and Django. 
On the frontend, I focused on creating an engaging user interface with features similar to YouTube, ensuring an excellent user experience. Meanwhile, in the backend, I leveraged Python and Django to build a robust system that handles data storage, user authentication, and content management.

This project not only highlights my proficiency in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also underscores my expertise in developing backend solutions with Python and Django. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and applying them to innovative web development projects.
